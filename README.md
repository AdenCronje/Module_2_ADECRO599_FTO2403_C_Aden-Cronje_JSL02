What I learned: During Jsl02 I learned more about if(){} statements and how they are used to check if data is either true or false.
                True being the if statement and else being the false statement. I also learned how you can use other methods to also reach the answer that you want.

Struggles: My biggest struggle was at the beginning, when I was unsure of how I even wanted to go about writing the if statement.

Improvements: Do some more practice on debugging function.
